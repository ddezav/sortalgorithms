# sortalgorithms
different sort algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, insertion sort) implemented in Python, Go and C++
To compare execution time and complexity of them
Furthermore, we visualize the experiments with the follow amount of data entry (5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000, 20000, 30000, 40000 ,50000, 60000,70000,80000)
